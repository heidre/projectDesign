## Where do we envision this project will go in 5 years?
* As an ongoing feature of the user's digital reading practices. 
* As a part of rhetoric and composition classes, particularly in lessons on composition and revision. 
* Ideally, this project will have social media sharing capabilites on Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, and tumblr. We would also like to include a "confidence meter" that rates its own perceived accuracy in the listed score.
