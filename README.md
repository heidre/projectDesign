# ExposéMoi: Uncovering the Politics of Today's Most Passive News Story (or Is It Just Bad Writing?)

## What is ExposéMoi?

ExposéMoi is a web browser plug-in that (1) scans through journal and news articles and websites, (2) identifies the uses of the passive voice, and (3) assesses how the passive voice correlates to a journal’s political alignment. The plug-in (4) produces a score of the frequency of passive voice at the sentence level. 


## Why use ExposéMoi?

Recent media and news articles tend to use the passive voice to avoid blame or allocate responsibility, hide the agent, tone down intensity, complicate readability, and add verbiage and jargon to mask or distort the meaning of the text. Ultimately, the use of the passive voice is a technique for wilfully concealing the truth.


## Files and Specifications 

All relevant files for the extension are stored under the file name "extension.zip". 


## Instructions 

1. Install the extension through Chrome.
2. Open the extension by clicking the pop-up on the top right-hand corner of the browser toolbar. 
3. Click the "ExposeMoi" button and wait for the page to load results. This button will highlight the passive phrases in the webpage and list the total instances in the pop-up menu after "total".
4. The extension will automatically output a percentage for passive occurrences per sencentence in the article. 7 instances within 7 sentences will produce a 100% rating, and so forth.
5. Finally, click "Tweet Score." This button will redirect you to a separate tab with a pre-generated tweet that lists the score and url of the page you have just rated. 

A few notes:
1. The extension will only work if the steps are followed in this given order.
2. As there is no "reset" button, the page must be refreshed in order to begin again. 
3. If the pop-up is closed before completing all the steps, re-opening it and continuing on to the next step will not work. You must refresh the page and begin from the first step again. 


## Dependencies 

The current version of ExposéMoi operates as a chrome extension exclusively. Extending it to other platforms like Explorer and Firefox is in progress. 


## ExposéMoi in Action!

We ran our plugin on Wikipedia's "English Passive Voice" article.

## Audience 

While journalists, news readers, and the general public are our primary audience, our project could also be a pedagogical tool for use in teaching composition. Teachers could use this plugin as a tool to teach elements of clear and effective writing, rhetorical analysis, paraphrasing, summarizing, and revision.

## Jokes and Humour 

- ExposéMoi's function for counting sentences still requires fine-tuning. Using ExposéMoi on some webpages and Wikipedia articles may interfere with the page's script, although it will not affect readability.
