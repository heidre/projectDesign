<b>Statement</b><br><br>
<i>ExposeMoi</i> is a web browser plug-in that (1) scans through journal and news articles and websites, (2) identifies the uses of the passive voice, and (3) assesses how the passive voice correlates to a journalâ€™s political alignment. The plug-in (4) produces a score of the frequency of passive voice at the sentence level. Recent media and news articles tend to use the passive voice to avoid blame or allocate responsibility, hide the agent, tone down intensity, complicate readability, and add verbiage and jargon to mask or distort the meaning of the text. Ultimately, the use of the passive voice is a technique for wilfully concealing the truth.
